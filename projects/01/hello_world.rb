# This is a comment!  What does that mean?  Well it means the line starts
# with a '#', and Ruby will ignore anything that comes after that until the
# end of the line.  Comments are one of the best, and sometimes most under-used
# tools you have!  They are for leaving messages for others looking at your
# source-code.  Now that we have that out of the way, it's time to write a
# program that is as old as time itself, "Hello World"!

puts 'Hello World'

# To run this code you can type this in your "terminal"
#
#    ruby hello_world.rb

# Depending on what other languages you have used in the past, this may seem
# a bit off.  To do a little explaining, `puts` is a method that takes a
# "string" of text and prints it to standard out, which in this case should
# be your terminal screen.  Here is what the same program would look like in
# in C++
#
#   #include <iostream.h>
#
#   main()
#   {
#     cout << "Hello World";
#     return 0;
#   }
